\section{Whitespace}

\subsection{Spaces before semi-colons}
The rule we've settled on is that grammar rules have a single space before the semi-colon, while everything else doesn't have a space before the semi-colon, like normal.

\subsection{Colons}
Numerous experiments have shown that colons fare best with both preceding and succeeding whitespace.

\subsection{Spaces after the comment character}
Insert one space after the comment character.

\subsection{Parentheses and Spaces}
Our field engineers have noted that wild parentheses prefer large open spaces for their pastures.
Unfortunately, the best we can do in our case is provide captive parentheses exactly one preceding and one succeeding space.
One exception to this rule are regex parasites, which attach themselves directly to closing parantheses, for clarity: ``\textit{)*}''\\
Successive parenthesis do not require spaces if they are of the same species (either clausus or aperta).
